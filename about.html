                Louis Yona Shawa and Esther Banda’s journey of love began 15 years ago in the heart of Blantyre, Manyowe Kausiwa village. What started as two young souls crossing paths at Dalaph and Manyowe Primary Schools grew into a love story that has defied odds, inspired faith, and flourished into a family rooted in God’s grace.

                As we transitioned into different paths in life—Esther moving on to Providence Secondary School and Louis attending Namiwawa Community Secondary School—our connection only grew stronger, despite the physical distance.

                Esther’s academic brilliance led her to the University of Malawi, Chancellor College, where she earned both her degree and Master's. Louis, on the other hand, pursued an Advanced Diploma in ICT at The Polytechnic Continuing and is now completing his Bachelor of Management Information Systems at Malawi College of Accountancy.

                Yet, our journey was not without its challenges. There were moments when people doubted us, when whispers surrounded us, saying we couldn’t make it.

                Every obstacle we encountered only strengthened our bond. Together, we silenced the voices that said we couldn’t make it, proving that with God at the center of our relationship, anything is possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                God has blessed us with two beautiful children, our son Nathan Thanthwe Shawa, and our daughter Natalie Kuleza Shawa, who are living reminders of the love and grace that has carried us through.
